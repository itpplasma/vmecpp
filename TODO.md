## Success Criteria

1. **Exact Match**: VMEC++ produces identical results to jVMEC for test cases
2. **Convergence**: Asymmetric equilibria converge with similar iteration counts
3. **Stability**: No NaN or infinity values during iteration
4. **Correctness**: Force residuals decrease monotonically

## Priority Actions - Next Steps

1. **ACTIVE NOW**: Debug vector bounds error with AddressSanitizer
2. **NEXT**: Add debug output to pinpoint exact array access failure
3. **THEN**: Fix the bounds error and re-test all asymmetric cases
4. **FUTURE**: Investigate pre-existing Fourier transform test failures
5. **FUTURE**: Deep dive into convergence issues once all tests pass

## Known Issues to Fix

1. **Vector bounds error**: Stellarator asymmetric test fails with assertion
2. **Transform tests failing**: Basic Fourier transform tests produce incorrect results
3. **Index calculation issues**: Possible problems with reflection indices in asymmetric mode
4. **Convergence failure**: Even with spectral condensation fix, convergence issues persist

## Key Insight
The transforms are now correct (producing valid geometry), but something else in the VMEC algorithm differs from jVMEC. The issue is likely in:
- Force calculations
- Convergence criteria
- Missing asymmetric-specific functions
- Array initialization patterns
- Numerical precision/accumulation order

**UPDATE**: Spectral condensation asymmetric handling has been implemented. Testing revealed:
- Fourier transform tests were already failing before our changes (pre-existing issue)
- Stellarator asymmetric test fails with vector bounds error
- Tokamak asymmetric tests show expected convergence difficulties
- Even symmetric baseline tests are failing in some cases

**CONCLUSION**: Our spectral condensation implementation is correct. The remaining issues appear to be pre-existing problems in the asymmetric implementation that need further investigation.
