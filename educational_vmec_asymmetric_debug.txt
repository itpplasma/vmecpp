Educational VMEC asymmetric test case behavior analysis:

1. INITIAL STATE:
   - NS = 17, 5 Fourier modes, FTOLV = 1.000E-11
   - Multiple negative tau values reported:
     * tau = -0.75 to -3.38 (very negative)
     * tau_main = -0.58 to -3.22

2. AXIS RECOVERY TRIGGERED:
   - "INITIAL JACOBIAN CHANGED SIGN!"
   - "TRYING TO IMPROVE INITIAL MAGNETIC AXIS GUESS"
   - Uses full theta range for asymmetric mode
   - Initial axis: R=0, Z=0
   - Final recovered axis: R=6.1188, Z=0.1197

3. POST-RECOVERY BEHAVIOR:
   - Dramatically improved tau values:
     * tau = -0.18 to positive values
     * tau_main = -0.004 to +0.076
   - Convergence achieves much better Jacobian behavior
   - Final negative tau range: -0.18 to -0.03 (much better)

4. KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:
   - Axis recovery produces significant improvement in Jacobian
   - Educational VMEC successfully continues after BAD_JACOBIAN
   - Final result shows proper asymmetric equilibrium convergence

5. COMPARISON WITH VMEC++:
   - VMEC++ now continues past BAD_JACOBIAN (✓ FIXED)
   - VMEC++ reaches axis recovery stage (✓ WORKING)
   - Need to verify: Does VMEC++ axis recovery improve tau values like educational_VMEC?
   - Need to verify: Does VMEC++ continue to convergence after recovery?
